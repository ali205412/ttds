## Preprocessing in the IR Pipeline

### Context and Importance

**Position in IR System:**
```
Raw Documents → Text Transformation → BOW Representation → Index Creation
                        ↑
                 PREPROCESSING
                        ↓
Raw Queries → Text Transformation → BOW Representation → Query Processing
```

**Objective:**
Find the optimal text transformation technique (preprocessing) that leads to better matching between different forms of words in documents and queries.

### The Challenge

**Core Problem:**
Raw text contains multiple surface forms for the same underlying concept. Effective preprocessing must:
- **Standardize variations:** Handle different representations of the same meaning
- **Preserve semantics:** Maintain important distinctions while removing superficial differences
- **Optimize matching:** Improve recall without significantly harming precision
- **Maintain consistency:** Apply identical processing to both documents and queries

**Examples of Surface Variation:**
- Morphological: "run", "running", "runs", "ran"
- Case: "Apple" vs. "apple"
- Punctuation: "U.S.A." vs. "USA"
- Spelling: "color" vs. "colour"

## What Constitutes a "Word"?

### Terminology in Information Retrieval

**"Terms" vs. "Words":**
In IR, we refer to word-elements as **"terms"** which can include:
- **Complete words:** "preprocessing"
- **Word fragments:** "pre" (prefix)
- **Numbers and codes:** "INFR11145"
- **Compound units:** Multi-word expressions treated as single terms

### Standard Preprocessing Pipeline

**Sequential Processing Steps:**
1. **Tokenization:** Split text into candidate terms
2. **Stop word removal:** Filter high-frequency, low-content words
3. **Normalization:** Standardize surface representations
4. **Stemming:** Reduce morphological variations

**Goal:** Identify the optimal form of each term to be indexed to achieve the best retrieval performance.

## Tokenization

### Definition and Purpose

**Tokenization:** The process of breaking continuous text into individual tokens (potential index terms).

**Basic Example:**
```
Input:  "Friends, Romans; and Countrymen!"
Output: ["Friends", "Romans", "and", "Countrymen"]
```

**Process Flow:**
```
Sentence → Tokenization (splitting) → Tokens → Further Processing → Index Terms
```

### Standard Tokenization Approach

**Basic Technique:**
- **Split at non-letter characters:** Use punctuation and whitespace as boundaries
- **Regular expression pattern:** `\w+` (word characters only)
- **Result:** Each token becomes a candidate for an index entry after additional processing

**Token Definition:**
A token is an instance of a sequence of characters in some particular document that are grouped together as a useful semantic unit for processing.

### Tokenization Challenges

#### Possessives and Contractions

**Possessive Forms:**
- **"Finland's" capital** → Finland? Finlands? Finland's?
- **Decision impact:** Affects whether possessive and non-possessive forms match
- **Considerations:** User search behavior, linguistic appropriateness

**Contractions and Apostrophes:**
- **English:** "don't", "can't", "I'll"
- **Solutions:** Expand to full forms vs. keep contracted vs. split into components

#### Hyphenated Terms

**Compound Terms:**
- **"Hewlett-Packard"** → One token or two?
- **"state-of-the-art"** → How many meaningful units?
- **"co-education"** → Keep hyphen, remove, or split?

**Current Best Practice:**
- **Break up hyphenated sequences:** Split into individual components
- **User flexibility:** Allow users to include hyphens in queries when beneficial
- **Domain-specific handling:** Different strategies for different application areas

**Case Variations:**
- **"lowercase"** vs. **"lower-case"** vs. **"lower case"**
- **Solution:** Standardize to most common form or support all variations

#### Numeric Expressions

**Date Formats:**
- **American:** "3/20/91"
- **European:** "20/3/91"
- **Spelled out:** "Mar. 20, 1991"
- **Challenge:** Same date, multiple representations

**Identifiers:**
- **Course codes:** "INFR11145"
- **Phone numbers:** "(800) 234-2333"
- **Decision:** Treat as single tokens or split into components

#### Web-Specific Content

**URLs:**
- **Simple:** "http://www.bbc.co.uk"
- **Complex:** "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-41376577"
- **Options:** No split, domain-only split, full parsing, complete removal

**Social Media Elements:**
- **Hashtags:** "#BlackLivesMatter", "#black_lives_matter", "#blacklivesmatter"
- **Mentions:** "@username"
- **Challenge:** Maintain semantic integrity while enabling search

**Multi-word Entities:**
- **"San Francisco"** → One semantic unit or two searchable terms?
- **Decision methods:** Dictionary lookup, statistical analysis, user behavior

### Language-Specific Tokenization

#### French Contractions

**L'ensemble Problem:**
- **Forms:** L? L'? Le?
- **Objective:** "l'ensemble" should match "un ensemble"
- **Historical note:** Google didn't handle this correctly until 2003
- **Solution:** Normalize contractions to base forms

#### German Compound Words

**Compound Splitting:**
- **Example:** "Lebensversicherungsgesellschaftsangestellter"
- **Translation:** "life insurance company employee"
- **Performance impact:** 15% improvement in German retrieval systems
- **Method:** Algorithmic decomposition based on linguistic rules

**Implementation:**
- **Dictionary-based:** Use lexicon of compound components
- **Statistical:** Learn splitting patterns from data
- **Hybrid approaches:** Combine multiple methods for better accuracy

#### Chinese and Japanese Segmentation

**No Natural Word Boundaries:**
- **Chinese example:** 莎拉波娃现在居住在美国东南部的佛罗里达
- **Challenge:** Identify meaningful word units without space separators
- **Tokenization becomes segmentation:** Requires sophisticated algorithms

**Segmentation Methods:**
- **Dictionary-based:** Maximum matching using word lexicons
- **Statistical models:** N-gram and probabilistic approaches
- **Machine learning:** Neural networks for sequence labeling
- **Hybrid systems:** Combine multiple approaches for robustness

### Practical Tokenization Approaches

#### Basic Implementation

**Simple Strategy:**
- **Split at non-letter characters** using regular expressions
- **Process `\w` characters** (letters, digits, underscore)
- **Discard everything else** (punctuation, special symbols)

**Code Example (Conceptual):**
```python
import re
tokens = re.findall(r'\w+', text.lower())
```

#### Domain-Specific Adaptations

**Social Media Processing:**
- **Preserve hashtags:** Keep "#" as part of tokens
- **Preserve mentions:** Keep "@" as part of tokens
- **Example:** "#BlackLivesMatter" → single token vs. split components

**URL Handling Strategies:**
- **No splitting:** Treat entire URL as single token
- **Domain extraction:** Extract only domain portion
- **Full parsing:** Break into meaningful components
- **Complete removal:** Delete URLs entirely

**Specialized Domains:**
- **Medical texts:** Handle protein names, drug identifiers
- **Legal documents:** Preserve citation formats, case references
- **Scientific papers:** Handle chemical formulas, mathematical expressions

## Stop Word Removal

### Definition and Rationale

**Stop Words:** The most common words in a language that typically carry minimal semantic content for determining document topic or relevance.

**Transformation Example:**
```
Input:  "This is a very exciting lecture on the technologies of text"
Output: "exciting lecture technologies text"
```

### Characteristics of Stop Words

**Common Examples:**
- **Articles:** the, a, an
- **Prepositions:** of, to, for, on, in, with, by
- **Pronouns:** he, she, I, him, her, it, they
- **Auxiliary verbs:** is, are, was, were, has, have
- **Modifiers:** very, quite, rather, more, most

**Statistical Properties:**
- **High frequency:** Typically account for 30-40% of running text
- **Low semantic value:** Limited impact on document aboutness or topic
- **Grammatical function:** Provide sentence structure rather than content meaning

### Domain-Specific Stop Words

**Social Media:**
- **"RT"** (retweet indicator)
- **Example:** "RT @realDonalTrump Mexico will pay for the wall"
- **Context:** Twitter-specific conventions

**Patent Documents:**
- **Legal formulaic language:** "said", "claim", "wherein", "method"
- **Example:** "a said method that extracts features from said input"
- **Frequency:** These terms appear constantly but add little semantic value

**Academic Literature:**
- **Structural terms:** "abstract", "introduction", "conclusion", "references"
- **Methodology terms:** "study", "analysis", "research", "data"
- **Field-specific:** Different disciplines have characteristic high-frequency terms

### Arguments For and Against Stop Word Removal

#### Arguments FOR Removal

**Storage Efficiency:**
- **Space savings:** Significant reduction in index size
- **Reduced processing:** Fewer terms to process during search
- **Cost-benefit:** High frequency terms consume disproportionate resources

**Query Processing Speed:**
- **Faster lookup:** Fewer terms to search in inverted index
- **Reduced computation:** Less similarity calculation overhead
- **Network efficiency:** Smaller data transfer requirements

**Noise Reduction:**
- **Focus on content:** Emphasizes semantically meaningful terms
- **Improved precision:** Reduces matches on non-topical terms

#### Arguments AGAINST Removal

**Phrase Query Problems:**
- **Famous phrases:** "Let it be", "To be or not to be"
- **Impossible queries:** Cannot search for phrases containing stop words
- **User frustration:** Queries fail when they should succeed

**Positional and Relational Queries:**
- **Direction matters:** "flights **to** London **from** Edinburgh" vs. "flights **from** London **to** Edinburgh"
- **Semantic importance:** Prepositions carry crucial meaning in some contexts
- **Query intent:** Stop words can completely change meaning

#### Modern Web Search Practice

**Trend Toward Retention:**
- **Advanced compression:** Storage costs less prohibitive with modern techniques
- **Query optimization:** Sophisticated algorithms handle stop words efficiently
- **Probabilistic models:** Statistical retrieval models naturally assign low weights

**Benefits of Keeping Stop Words:**
- **Complete phrase support:** Enable searching for any phrase
- **Better query understanding:** Preserve grammatical relationships
- **User satisfaction:** Match user expectations more accurately

### Creating Stop Word Lists

#### Frequency-Based Method

**Process:**
1. **Collect statistics:** Sort all terms in collection by frequency
2. **Manual review:** Examine top N terms (typically 100-500)
3. **Semantic filtering:** Select terms lacking content significance
4. **Language-specific lists:** Create separate lists for each language

**Criteria for Selection:**
- **High frequency:** Appears in large percentage of documents
- **Low content value:** Doesn't help distinguish document topics
- **Grammatical function:** Primarily structural rather than semantic role

#### Available Resources

**Pre-built Lists:**
- **NLTK (Python library):** Comprehensive lists for multiple languages
- **Academic collections:** http://members.unine.ch/jacques.savoy/clef/index.html
- **Language-specific resources:** Tailored to particular languages and domains

**Customization:**
- **Domain adaptation:** Add field-specific high-frequency terms
- **Quality control:** Remove terms that might be content-bearing in specific domains
- **User behavior:** Analyze query logs to identify problematic stop words

## Normalization

### Definition and Objectives

**Normalization:** The process of making words with different surface forms appear identical to improve matching between documents and queries.

**Core Problem:**
```
Document: "this is my CAR!!"
Query: "car"
Question: Should "car" match "CAR"?
```

**Fundamental Principle:** Apply identical tokenization and normalization steps to both documents and queries to ensure consistent matching behavior.

### Case Folding

**Basic Case Folding:**
Convert all letters to lowercase for consistent matching.

**Examples:**
- CAR, Car, caR → car
- LONDON, London, london → london

#### Case Folding Considerations

**Proper Noun Distinctions:**
- **"Windows"** (operating system) vs. **"windows"** (architectural features)
- **"Apple"** (company) vs. **"apple"** (fruit)
- **Trade-off:** Lose some precision to gain recall

**User Behavior:**
- **Query patterns:** Users typically input lowercase queries
- **Expectation:** System should be case-insensitive by default
- **Exception handling:** Some searches may require case sensitivity

**Acronym Handling:**
- **"USA"** vs. **"usa"**
- **"PhD"** vs. **"phd"**
- **Context dependency:** Some acronyms lose meaning when lowercased

### Diacritic and Accent Removal

**Purpose:** Normalize accented characters to base forms for broader matching.

#### Examples Across Languages

**French:**
- **"Château"** → **"chateau"**
- **"élève"** → **"eleve"**
- **"français"** → **"francais"**

**German:**
- **"Tübingen"** → **"tuebingen"**
- **"Müller"** → **"mueller"** or **"muller"**
- **"Straße"** → **"strasse"**

**Spanish:**
- **"niño"** → **"nino"**
- **"corazón"** → **"corazon"**

**Arabic:**
- **كُتُب** → **كتب** (removing diacritical marks)
- **Complex script:** Multiple accent types affect pronunciation and meaning

#### Benefits of Accent Removal

**Cross-Variant Matching:**
- **User convenience:** Users don't always input accents correctly
- **Keyboard limitations:** Not all keyboards easily produce accented characters
- **OCR errors:** Scanned documents often lose accents in digitization

**Broader Recall:**
- **Spelling variations:** Handle different conventions for the same word
- **International usage:** Same word used differently across regions

### Equivalence Classes

**Concept:** Group different surface representations that refer to the same underlying concept.

#### Common Equivalence Examples

**Abbreviation Expansion:**
- **"U.S.A."** ↔ **"USA"**
- **"Ph.D."** ↔ **"PhD"**
- **"Dr."** ↔ **"Doctor"**

**Numeric Representations:**
- **"92.3"** ↔ **"923"** ↔ **"92 3"** (context-dependent)
- **"2020"** ↔ **"twenty twenty"** (date/year representations)

**Compound Word Variations:**
- **"multi-disciplinary"** ↔ **"multidisciplinary"** ↔ **"multi disciplinary"**
- **"email"** ↔ **"e-mail"** ↔ **"electronic mail"**

#### Implementation Criteria

**Consistency Requirement:**
- **Document-query alignment:** Same processing for both documents and queries
- **Predictable behavior:** Users should understand how system handles variants

**User Behavior Analysis:**
- **Common patterns:** Study how users actually search
- **Domain conventions:** Follow standard practices in specific fields
- **Cultural considerations:** Regional differences in usage patterns

## Stemming

### Definition and Motivation

**Stemming:** The process of reducing morphological variations of words to common stems to improve recall by matching different forms of the same concept.

**Motivating Example:**
```
Query: "play"
Desired matches: "played", "playing", "player", "plays"
Current problem: Without stemming, these don't match
```

### Types of Morphological Variation

#### Inflectional Morphology

**Plurals:**
- **cat** → **cats**
- **child** → **children**
- **mouse** → **mice**

**Verb Tenses:**
- **run** → **ran**, **running**, **runs**
- **go** → **went**, **gone**, **going**
- **be** → **am**, **is**, **are**, **was**, **were**

#### Derivational Morphology

**Part of Speech Changes:**
- **organize** → **organization** (verb to noun)
- **happy** → **happiness** (adjective to noun)
- **nation** → **national** (noun to adjective)

**Meaning Extensions:**
- **teach** → **teacher** (person who teaches)
- **read** → **readable** (able to be read)
- **care** → **careful** (full of care)

### Core Assumption

**Aboutness Preservation:**
In most cases, the core topic or "aboutness" of a word does not change across morphological variants. Therefore, matching different surface forms of the same concept improves retrieval effectiveness.

### Stemming Effectiveness

#### Performance Impact by Language

**English:**
- **Improvement:** 5-10% increase in retrieval effectiveness
- **Moderate impact:** English has relatively simple morphology
- **Cost-benefit:** Generally worthwhile for most applications

**Highly Inflected Languages:**

**Finnish:**
- **Improvement:** 30% increase in retrieval effectiveness
- **Complex morphology:** Extensive case system, vowel harmony

**Arabic:**
- **Improvement:** 50+ % increase in retrieval effectiveness
- **Root-pattern system:** Triliteral roots with extensive prefix/suffix patterns
- **Example complexity:**

```
English: "children" (singular: child)
Arabic:
- أطفال (atfaal) - children
- طفل (tifl) - child (masculine)
- طفلة (tifla) - child (feminine)
- أطفالنا (atfaaluna) - our children
- بأطفالهم (bi-atfaalihim) - with their children
```

#### Multilingual Example: "Children"

**English Simplicity:**
- **Forms:** child, children
- **Variations:** Limited morphological complexity

**Arabic Complexity:**
Multiple forms all meaning "children" or related concepts:
- **Base plurals:** أولاد، أطفال، صبيان
- **With possessives:** أولادنا، أطفالنا، صبياننا
- **With prepositions:** بأولادهم، لأطفالنا
- **Different cases:** الأولادَ، الأطفالِ

### Stemming Algorithm Types

#### Dictionary-Based Stemming

**Method:** Use precompiled lists of morphologically related words.

**Advantages:**
- **High accuracy:** Linguistically informed relationships
- **Handles irregulars:** Can include irregular forms (go → went)
- **Precise control:** Exact specification of relationships

**Disadvantages:**
- **Limited coverage:** Only handles words in dictionary
- **Maintenance overhead:** Requires extensive linguistic resources
- **Language-specific:** Separate dictionaries needed for each language

#### Algorithmic Stemming

**Method:** Use computational rules to remove affixes and reduce words to stems.

**Advantages:**
- **Broad coverage:** Handles novel words not in dictionaries
- **Efficiency:** Fast processing with simple rules
- **Portability:** Easier to adapt across languages

**Disadvantages:**
- **Error-prone:** May create incorrect stems
- **Overstemming:** Conflate unrelated words
- **Understemming:** Fail to reduce related words to same stem

### Simple Algorithmic Stemming

#### Suffix-S Stemmer

**Basic Rules:**
```
cats → cat
lakes → lake
windows → window
```

**Algorithm:** Remove 's' endings assuming plural formation.

**Limitations:**

**False Negatives (Understemming):**
- **supplies** → **supplie** (incorrect stem)
- **flies** → **flie** (incorrect stem)

**False Positives (Overstemming):**
- **James** → **Jame** (proper noun incorrectly stemmed)
- **glass** → **glas** (not a plural form)

### Porter Stemmer

**Overview:** Most widely used algorithm for stemming English text.

#### Algorithm Structure

**Five Sequential Phases:**
- **Phase 1:** Handle plurals and past tenses
- **Phase 2:** Remove derivational suffixes
- **Phase 3:** Handle -ize/-ation endings
- **Phase 4:** Remove -ment/-ness suffixes
- **Phase 5:** Final cleanup and normalization

**Processing Method:**
- **Sequential application:** Each phase operates on output of previous phase
- **Rule-based:** Each phase consists of ordered rules
- **Longest suffix:** Apply rule matching the longest possible suffix

#### Sample Porter Stemmer Rules

**Phase 1 Examples:**
```
sses → ss     (processes → process)
ies → i       (replies → repli)
ss → ss       (caress → caress)
s → ε         (cats → cat)
```

**Phase 2 Examples:**
```
ational → ate  (relational → relate)
tional → tion  (conditional → condition)
enci → ence    (valenci → valence)
anci → ance    (hesitanci → hesitance)
```

**Phase 4 Examples:**
```
ement → ε      (replacement → replac)
ment → ε       (adjustment → adjust)
ent → ε        (dependent → depend)
```

**Morphological Conventions:**
- **Measure concept:** Count vowel-consonant sequences to determine stem length
- **Conditional rules:** Apply rules only when stem meets length requirements
- **Suffix priority:** Longer suffixes take precedence over shorter ones

#### Porter Stemmer Characteristics

**Aggressive Reduction:**
- **Philosophy:** Prefer overstemming to understemming
- **Result:** Creates non-word stems that represent multiple surface forms

**Example Output:**
- **"replacement"** → **"replac"**
- **"organizing"** → **"organ"**
- **"successful"** → **"success"**

**Stem Properties:**
- **Non-words:** Stems are often not valid English words
- **Internal use only:** Users never see stemmed forms
- **Optimal matching:** Single stem represents multiple surface forms

### Understanding Stemmed Output

#### Stemmed Terms Are Not Words

**Important Distinction:**
- **Stems:** repli, replac, suppli, inform, retriev, anim
- **Status:** These are terms, not words
- **Visibility:** Internal to IR system, never shown to users
- **Purpose:** Optimal matching between surface variants

**Semantic Grouping:**
Each stem represents multiple surface forms:
- **"replac"** ← replace, replaces, replaced, replacing, replacer, replacers, replacement, replacements
- **"organ"** ← organize, organizes, organized, organizing, organizer, organization, organizational

#### Practical Implementation

**System Architecture:**
- **Document processing:** Apply stemming during indexing
- **Query processing:** Apply identical stemming to user queries
- **Index storage:** Store stemmed terms in inverted index
- **Result presentation:** Show original document text to users

**Performance Monitoring:**
- **Effectiveness metrics:** Measure impact on precision and recall
- **Error analysis:** Identify problematic stemming decisions
- **User satisfaction:** Monitor whether stemming improves user experience

### Common Preprocessing Pipeline

#### Standard Sequence

**Step-by-Step Process:**
```
1. Raw Text Input
2. Tokenization → Split at non-letter characters
3. Stop Word Removal → Filter common words using predefined lists
4. Case Folding → Convert to lowercase
5. Stemming → Apply Porter stemmer (or equivalent)
6. Indexed Terms Output
```

**Implementation Guidelines:**

**Tokenization:**
```python
import re
tokens = re.findall(r'\w+', text)
```

**Stop Word Removal:**
```python
stopwords = load_stopword_list()  # From NLTK or custom list
filtered_tokens = [t for t in tokens if t not in stopwords]
```

**Case Folding:**
```python
normalized_tokens = [token.lower() for token in filtered_tokens]
```

**Stemming:**
```python
from porter_stemmer import PorterStemmer
stemmer = PorterStemmer()
stemmed_tokens = [stemmer.stem(token) for token in normalized_tokens]
```

#### Domain Adaptations

**Social Media Processing:**
- **Hashtag preservation:** Keep "#" and "@" during tokenization
- **Emoji handling:** Decide whether to preserve or remove
- **URL processing:** Extract, normalize, or remove web addresses

**Multilingual Collections:**
- **Language detection:** Identify document language before processing
- **Language-specific rules:** Apply appropriate stemmer for each language
- **Script normalization:** Handle different writing systems consistently

### Preprocessing Limitations

#### Morphological Irregularities

**Irregular Verbs:**
- **go** ↔ **went** (not handled by suffix-based stemming)
- **see** ↔ **saw** (requires dictionary-based approaches)
- **be** ↔ **was/were** (suppletive forms)

**Spelling Variations:**
- **British vs. American:** colour/color, tokenisation/tokenization
- **Historical variants:** old vs. modern spelling conventions

**Synonyms and Related Terms:**
- **car** vs. **vehicle** vs. **automobile**
- **UK** vs. **Britain** vs. **United Kingdom**
- **TV** vs. **television**

#### Solutions Beyond Basic Preprocessing

**Query Expansion:**
- **Automatic expansion:** Add related terms to user queries
- **Thesaurus integration:** Use controlled vocabularies
- **Statistical expansion:** Learn term relationships from data

**Advanced Normalization:**
- **Semantic analysis:** Understanding meaning beyond surface form
- **Context-aware processing:** Adapt based on document type and domain
- **Machine learning:** Train systems to learn optimal preprocessing

### Asymmetric Expansion

#### Concept and Motivation

**Definition:** Maintain relationships between normalized and unnormalized tokens rather than reducing everything to canonical forms.

**Alternative to Equivalence Classing:**
Instead of mapping multiple variants to single form, preserve distinctions when meaningful.

#### Example Application

**Case-Sensitive Distinctions:**
```
Query: "window"  → Search: [window, windows]
Query: "windows" → Search: [windows, Windows]
Query: "Windows" → Search: [Windows]
```

**Rationale:**
- **"window"** (generic) → Include architectural and software contexts
- **"windows"** (plural) → Include plural architectural + software brand
- **"Windows"** (capitalized) → Likely refers specifically to Microsoft Windows

#### Asymmetric Benefits and Drawbacks

**Benefits:**
- **Preserves distinctions:** Maintains meaningful differences when appropriate
- **User intent sensitivity:** Respects how users formulate queries
- **Flexible matching:** Can handle both specific and general information needs

**Drawbacks:**
- **Increased complexity:** More vocabulary terms to manage and store
- **Longer queries:** Multiple expansion terms increase processing time
- **Statistical complications:** "car" and "Car" treated as separate terms affects frequency calculations

**Practical Considerations:**
- **Memory overhead:** Larger inverted indexes and vocabularies
- **Processing time:** More terms to evaluate during ranking
- **Implementation complexity:** More sophisticated query processing logic
