### Programming Skill Questions
**Q: I'm not confident in my programming abilities. Should I take this course?**
**A:** Honest self-assessment is crucial. If Lab 0 is challenging, the full course will be very demanding. Consider strengthening programming skills before enrolling, as the course does not teach fundamental coding concepts.

### Auditing Questions
**Q: Can I audit the course without formal enrollment?**
**A:** All materials are publicly available, including lecture recordings. While informal following is possible, official auditing policies should be confirmed with university administration.

### Additional Preparation
**Q: What can I do now to prepare for success in this course?**
**A:**
- Strengthen Python programming skills, especially text processing
- Practice Unix/Linux command line operations
